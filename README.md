Earthquake Visualization Challenge: Leaflet- Challenge

This project involves creating an interactive map that visualizes earthquake data from a GeoJSON API. The goal is to display earthquake information such as magnitude, location, and depth, using dynamic markers and a color-coded legend to enhance data comprehension. The project utilizes Leaflet.js, D3.js, and real-time earthquake data.

Earthquake Visualization

Map Visualization

Tile Layer: Implement a map using Leaflet.js, ensuring the tile layer loads correctly to provide a foundation for plotting data points.
GeoJSON API Integration: Connect to a GeoJSON API using D3 to pull in real-time earthquake data and dynamically plot it on the map.
Markers for Magnitude: Create markers on the map where the size of each marker corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude, visually indicating the strength of each event.
Legend for Depth: Add a color-coded legend to the map to represent earthquake depth. The colors will indicate how shallow or deep each earthquake is.
Data Points

Scaling with Magnitude: Ensure that the markers scale according to the magnitude of the earthquake, making larger quakes more prominent on the map.
Color Coding by Depth: Assign colors to the data points based on the earthquake's depth, visually differentiating between shallow and deep quakes.
Tooltips with Detailed Information: Add tooltips to each marker, displaying the earthquake's magnitude, location, and depth when hovered over.
Accurate Location: All earthquake data points should be plotted in their correct geographical locations, ensuring accurate representation of the data.
